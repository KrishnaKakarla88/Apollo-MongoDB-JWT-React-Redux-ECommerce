# State Management using Redux Store

This is developed using React’s Redux + Context API.

## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the app’s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```

### Getting Started

Please read through the Redux [basic tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial) to add Redux to your application. Note that the docs will refer to additional packages that you'll need to complete this implementation.

> **Important:** Make sure you look through ALL the documentation, because there are newer methods available that can make these tools much easier to implement. Remember that React has gone through several iterations, and some React + Redux tutorials that you find will assume you aren't using Hooks.
